# COGS-118A-Project

For the final project of COGS 118A: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms, I compared the performance of a variety of classification algorithms on a series of novel datasets. The purpose of this analysis is to verify the findings of past papers on general algorithm performance, which is generally achieved by my findings.
